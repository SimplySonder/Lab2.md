### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

    Choosing a license allows the owner protection over their work and
    explicitly informs people on their rights with modification and sharing of
    the original code. Additionally, this also lets producers of derivative code
    know which licenses are appropriate to choose for their work.

### Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
    They may at some point attempt to retroactively apply a strict license that
    would hinder your ability to utilize or share their code, which may halt
    your work derived from it.

### Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.
    I agree with the claim. Their hesitation to release their code to the open
    with mistakes and commercially motivated decision to charge for .com
    domains ultimately drove them too far from the Open Source philosophy.

### Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source.
    Linux uses GPL v2 license as it allows users to obtain the source code, and
    in turn receives any improvements made by users. Linux specifically has
    stayed with GPL v2 as opposed to v3, because v3 isn't compatible with v2
    which makes it illegal to release Linux under v3 with any contributions
    licensed under v2 only. Furthermore, Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux, has
    publically said GPL v3 violates everything that GPLv2 stood for, as seen
    in the video below.
